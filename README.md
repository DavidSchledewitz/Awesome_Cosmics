# Awesome Cosmics
Hey, this is a github repository for all of you fellow hardware fans which wanna have some fun on the dark side!

This repository contains all the information needed to work with the
ALPIDE telescope, from Data acquisition, through conversion into different
formats, and finally analysis.

## Prerequisites

To understand how to work with this detector, a fundamental knowledge of
solid-state physics and specifically semiconductors is required. Please
refer to the literature recommendations before continuing.

What is also required is some basic knowledge of how to work with a linux
system. You should be able to move/rename and edit text files, as well
as install packages on your linux distribution of choice. There is no
recommendation here, as nearly all linux distributions will work fine.

Furthermore, you should have some experience in working with [Python](https://www.python.org/).

## First Steps

Download the repository as a `.zip` or clone it onto your system by executing
```shell
git clone https://github.com/DavidSchledewitz/Awesome_Cosmics.git
```
in your terminal emulator. If you do not have git installed, check out the 
installation tutorial
[here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

After you've successfully finished this step, you should have a copy of all
of the files contained in this repository on your local machine, and are ready
to work with them.
