The csv files included here at the beginning (namely event_HOLES-data, hitpp_data, npe_data) are some analyzed files from 2020. The data had some issues, so they should only be considered as examples.
They include: 
-the number of events with holes considering the number of planes of an event
-the number of hits on each plane
-the rate of n-plane-events (look into the data analysis notebook to see more to this topic)
