# ROOT Tutorial

ROOT is an data analysing tool which can be realy useful in handling big chunks of data. If necessary for you, you can do the tutorial, which is given here to learn the basics of ROOT

There are presentations in `/slides` and exercises for each slide. 
Each presentation and the corresponding exercises should take you approximately one day to finish. 
If you have problems with the exercises, there are some example codes, which will help you to solve the exercises. If you use them, be sure to understand what each step does!


Also: If your code doesn't work, it can be that you need to include the root packages in your code. As example we give you the code for day 2 within `\example_code`, where we included some well written functions and the corresponding packages.


After completing this course, you're going to be a ROOT expert ;)
Have fun!
